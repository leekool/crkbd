miryoku inspired 3x5+3 corne keymap utilising home row mods for gui, shift and ctrl, with shift in each far bottom corner
designed to be used with a trackball using the left hand, with mouse 1, 2 and 3 combos on the right half, and a pimoroni used for scrolling

tapping term per key and combo term per combo tuned for me to reduce accidental holds & combo activation

pimoroni mount i designed to make the pimoroni as level with the keys as possible, the pimoroni screws into both the mount and the pcb
the mount wraps around and braces against the trrs jacks to keep it stable

key overrides for open bracket keys whereby shift + bracket returns its closing bracket
